Feature: Memory

    As a player:
    - I want to play the classic memory game
    - So I want to match all the pairs of cards
    - and I need all the cards to have a pair
    
    How to refer to a card:
    - Using the (row, column) nomenclature
    - Rows and columns start from 1

    How to load the mock data
    - Using the <ctrl>+m keyboard combination to discover
      the load mock data form

    To define inline board mock data will use:
    "1" to "9" numbers to define card as pairs.
    "," as number separator
    "-" Row separator
    For example:
    "1,2,3-1,2,3"

    To define table board mock data will use:
    - | As separator
    For example:
      | 1 | 2 | 3 |
      | 2 | 1 | 3 |

    To define the board display will use:
    "." Unflipped card
    "1" to "9" numbers for flipped cards

        When the player right clicks on the card ("1", "1")    
        Then the card ("1", "1") should be flipped

    Scenario: Flipping a card already flipped - Clicking over a card already flipped
        Given the player loads the following mock data
        """
        | 1 | 1 |
        """
        And the player right clicks on the card ("1", "1")  
        And the player right clicks on the card ("1", "1")    
        Then the card ("1", "1") should be flipped

    Scenario: Flipping two cards 
        Given the player loads the following mock data
        """

        | 1 | 2 |
        """
        And the player right clicks on the card ("1", "1") 
        When the player right clicks on the card ("1", "2")
        Then the card ("1", "1") and the card ("1", "2") should be flipped

    Scenario: Flipping two cards - Unflipping after not matching  
        Given the player loads the following mock data
        """
        | 2 | 1 |
        | 1 | 2 |
        """
        And the card ("1", "1") and the card ("1", "2") are unflipped
        When the player right clicks on the card ("2", "1")  
        Then the card ("2", "1") should be flipped
        And the card ("1", "1") and the card ("1", "2") should be unflipped

    Scenario: Flipping two cards - Fipping other cards after a match 
        Given the player loads the following mock data
        """
        | 2 | 1 |
        | 1 | 2 |
