Feature: Memory

    As a player:
    - I want to play the classic memory game
    - So I want to match all the pairs of cards
    - and I need all the cards to have a pair
    
    How to refer to a card:
    - Using the (row, column) nomenclature
    - Rows and columns start from 1

    How to load the mock data
    - Using the <ctrl>+m keyboard combination to discover
      the load mock data form

    To define inline board mock data will use:
    "1" to "9" numbers to define card as pairs.
    "," as number separator
    "-" Row separator
    For example:
    "1,2,3-1,2,3"

    To define table board mock data will use:
    - | As separator
    For example:
      | 1 | 2 | 3 |
      | 2 | 1 | 3 |

    To define the board display will use:
    "." Unflipped card
    "1" to "9" numbers for flipped cards

        """
        | 1 | 1 |

        And the player right clicks on the card ("1", "1")    
        Then the card ("1", "1") should be flipped

    Scenario: Flipping two cards - Default scenario

        When the player right clicks on the card ("1", "2")
        Then the card ("1", "1") and the card ("1", "2") should be flipped

    Scenario: Flipping two cards - Unflipping after not matching  
        Given the player loads the following mock data
        """
        | 2 | 1 |
        | 1 | 2 |
        """
        And the card ("1", "1") and the card ("1", "2") are unflipped
